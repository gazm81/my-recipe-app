🛒 Ingredients

For the pudding:
• 1 cup (150g) all-purpose flour
• 1/4 cup (25g) cocoa powder
• 2/3 cup (150g) granulated sugar
• 2 tsp baking powder
• Pinch of salt
• 1/2 cup (125ml) milk
• 2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter, melted (or neutral oil)
• 1 tsp vanilla extract

For the sauce:
• 1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar
• 2 tbsp (20g) cocoa powder
• 1 1/4 cups (310ml) boiling water

🧑‍🍳 Instructions

🔹 Step 1: Preheat and prepare
• Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
• Grease a 1.5L (6-cup) baking dish with butter or cooking spray.

🔹 Step 2: Make the batter
• In the bowl of your Breville stand mixer, add the flour, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.
• Using the flat beater on the "Light Mixing" setting, stir until combined.
• Add milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract, then mix on the same setting until smooth.
• Pour the batter into the greased baking dish and spread evenly with a spatula.

🔹 Step 3: Make the sauce
• Combine the brown sugar and cocoa powder in a small bowl.
• Sprinkle this dry mixture evenly over the batter in the dish.
• Slowly pour the boiling water over the back of a spoon to cover the top (this ensures it doesn't disrupt the batter).

🔹 Step 4: Bake
• Place the dish in the oven and bake for 30–35 minutes or until the top is firm to the touch, and a luscious sauce is bubbling underneath.

🔹 Step 5: Serve
• Allow the pudding to cool for about 5 minutes. Scoop into bowls, ensuring you get both the cake and the sauce. Serve with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or a dollop of custard.

🍽️ Serving Tips:
Perfect with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or custard.
The sauce forms naturally underneath the pudding during baking - make sure to scoop from the bottom to get both cake and sauce!
