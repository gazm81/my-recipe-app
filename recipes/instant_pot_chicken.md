Instant Pot Whole Chicken
with Air-Fryer Grill Finish & Rich White-Wine Gravy

🧂 Ingredients

Chicken

1 whole chicken (1.4–1.7 kg ideal for pressure cooking)

1 tbsp olive oil

1 tsp paprika

½ tsp black pepper

1 tsp salt

4 cloves garlic (whole, peeled)

4 sprigs thyme (or 1 tsp dried)

Vegetables (for flavour + gravy base)

1 large onion, sliced

2 carrots, chopped

2 celery sticks, chopped

1 cup (250 mL) chicken stock or water

Gravy

¼ cup white wine

1 tbsp cornflour + 1 tbsp cold water (slurry)

Optional: 1 tbsp butter (for gloss & richness)

Salt/pepper to taste

🍳 Instructions

🔹 1. Prepare the chicken

Pat dry thoroughly.

Rub with olive oil, paprika, pepper, and salt.

Stuff garlic + thyme into the cavity.

🔹 2. Sauté in the Instant Pot

Press Sauté → High.

Add a splash of olive oil.

Cook the onions for 2–3 minutes.

Add carrots + celery and stir.

Move veggies aside and brown the chicken on all sides (4–6 minutes).

Tip: Browning = much deeper flavour for the gravy.

🔹 3. Add liquid + pressure cook

Lift chicken out briefly.

Spread vegetables evenly across the bottom.

Add 1 cup stock/water.

Return chicken on top, breast side up.

Cancel sauté.

Seal the lid.

Pressure Cook:
High pressure – 30 minutes (for 1.4–1.7 kg)

Natural release for 10–15 minutes, then quick-release remaining pressure.

🔹 4. Crisp the chicken in the air fryer (optional but perfect)

If you want golden, crispy skin:

Carefully lift chicken out (use trivet handles or tongs + spatula).

Transfer to air-fryer basket.

Air fry 200°C for 5–7 minutes, until skin is crisp and bronzed.

(Instant Vortex, Ninja, Philips etc all fine.)

🍷 5. Make the White-Wine Gravy

This is where the magic happens — and yes, the soft veggies become your gravy body.

Option A — Smooth restaurant-style gravy

Pour all cooking liquid + vegetables into a jug or pot.

Blend with a stick blender until completely smooth.

Return mixture to Instant Pot.

Option B — Classic strained gravy

Pour liquid through a sieve, pressing veg to extract flavour.

Discard solids.

Return liquid to the pot.

Finish the gravy

Press Sauté → High.

Add ¼ cup white wine and simmer 1–2 minutes to cook off alcohol.

Add cornflour slurry while whisking.

Simmer until thickened (2–3 minutes).

Optional: whisk in 1 tbsp butter for glossy, silky gravy.

Season with salt + pepper.

🍽️ 6. Serve

Slice chicken, plate with mash or roast vegetables, and spoon over generous amounts of the white-wine gravy.

🔧 Notes & Tips

✔ Vegetables

After pressure cooking they're soft — perfect for blending into the gravy for body, sweetness, and richness.

✔ Bigger chicken

If your chicken is 1.8–2.0 kg:
→ 35 minutes pressure cook + 15 min natural release.

✔ Extra flavour boosts

Add half a lemon to the cavity.

Add a splash of Worcestershire to the gravy.

Add thyme or rosemary to the gravy while simmering.
