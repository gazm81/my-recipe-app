🛒 Ingredients:
1kg chicken thigh fillets (or breast), whole or halved

1 onion, finely chopped

2 garlic cloves, minced

2 carrots, diced

2 celery stalks, diced

2 potatoes, peeled and diced small

360g frozen peas & corn mix (or 210g corn + 150g peas)

6 cups low-sodium chicken stock

1 tsp dried thyme

1 bay leaf

Salt and pepper, to taste

Optional:

1/2 cup risoni or small pasta (added near end)

1/2 cup cream (for creamy version)

Chopped parsley or chives for garnish

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
🔹 Step 1: Pressure Cook Base
Turn Instant Pot to sauté mode. Cook onion, garlic, carrot, and celery in a little oil (3–5 mins).

Add: chicken, stock, thyme, bay leaf, and potatoes.

Close lid and pressure cook for 12 mins (manual/high). Let pressure release naturally for at least 10 mins.

🔹 Step 2: Shred Chicken & Add Final Veg
Open lid, remove chicken and shred with two forks.

Return shredded chicken to pot. Add peas and corn.

Switch to slow cooker mode (low) for 1–2 hours to gently cook the peas and blend flavors.

🔹 Step 3: Optional Final Touch
Stir in pasta for final 15–20 mins, or add cream just before serving.

Taste and season. Garnish with herbs if using.

🍽️ Kid Serving Tips:
Serve with toasted Turkish bread, cheese toasties, or dinner rolls.

Blend 1–2 cups and stir back in for a creamier body (without cream).
