1 potato, peeled and diced (optional)

2 onions, chopped

3 garlic cloves, minced

3 sprigs fresh thyme (optional)

Instructions
Saut√© Aromatics:
Set your Instant Pot or pressure cooker to saut√© mode. Add olive oil or butter, then cook onions, celery, carrots, and garlic for about 5‚Äì7 minutes until softened and fragrant. Cancel saut√© mode.

Add Remaining Ingredients:
Add split peas, potato (if using), ham hock, thyme, bay leaves, and water/stock. Do not salt yet ‚Äî ham hocks can be salty.

Pressure Cook:
Seal the lid and pressure cook on high for 30 minutes. Allow natural release for at least 10‚Äì15 minutes before opening.

Remove Ham Hock:
Take out the ham hock and set it aside to cool slightly.

Slow Cook to Finish:
Switch to slow cooker mode (or transfer contents to a slow cooker). Cook on low for 2 hours. This deepens the flavor and thickens the soup naturally.

Prepare and Return Meat:
Strip the skin, bones, and fat from the ham hock. Roughly chop the meat and return it to the pot. Stir to combine.

Final Seasoning:
Taste and season with salt and pepper. Add a splash of vinegar or lemon juice if desired to brighten the flavor.

Serve:
Ladle into bowls and serve hot with crusty bread and butter.

üîÅ Optional Variations
Swap green split peas for yellow for a slightly sweeter profile.

Add a pinch of smoked paprika or chili flakes for extra depth.

Partially blend the soup with a stick blender if you want a creamier texture.
