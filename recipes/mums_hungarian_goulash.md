Hungarian Goulash Recipe (Inspired by Mum's Version)
Ingredients:
3 green capsicums (sliced)

2 kg chicken pieces (bone-in or boneless, as preferred)

3 onions (finely diced)

2 tins tomato soup (800 g each)

4–5 medium potatoes (peeled and cubed)

1 cup frozen peas (optional)

4–5 bacon stock cubes (or substitute with chicken stock cubes if unavailable)

1 can water (for each can of soup)

½ cup milk (optional, for creaminess)

Instructions:
Sauté the onions:

Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat with a drizzle of oil.

Add the diced onions and sauté until softened and lightly golden.

Add the soup and liquids:

Pour in the two cans of tomato soup.

Fill each empty can with water and add to the pot (2 cans of water in total).

Stir well to combine. If you prefer a creamier texture, add the milk at this stage.

Build the stew:

Add the chicken pieces, green capsicum slices, cubed potatoes, and stock cubes.

Stir to ensure the ingredients are evenly distributed.

Cook the goulash:

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.

Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer gently for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add the peas in the last 10 minutes if using.

Check and adjust:

Taste the goulash and adjust seasoning as needed. The stock cubes should provide plenty of flavor, but feel free to add salt or pepper to taste.

Serve:

Serve hot in bowls, accompanied by crusty bread or over buttered noodles for a complete meal.
